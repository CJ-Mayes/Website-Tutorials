This week’s blog features a fun data art style inspired by The Flerlage Twins. The author aims to create SVG shapes filled with packed circles, differing from the Twins' artistic approach. To follow along, you need an SVG file, the provided code, and optionally Tableau. The code reads the SVG, determines boundaries, and packs circles within them, ensuring they don’t overlap. It also allows for customization, such as changing circle sizes and numbers. Instructions for using the output in Tableau are provided, along with suggestions for further experimentation.
