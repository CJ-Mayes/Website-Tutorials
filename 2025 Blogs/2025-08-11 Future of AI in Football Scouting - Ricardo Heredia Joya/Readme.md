Ricardo, a former doctor turned data scientist, shares his journey into football analytics. Using Python, he scrapes match data from WhoScored and Fotmob to create visual post-match reports. He explains his process: data extraction, cleaning, visualization, and dashboard creation.
Ricardo predicts data scientists in football will increasingly need end-to-end skills from data engineering to deployment, with AI literacy becoming essential. For beginners, he recommends resources including his Substack, McKay Johns' courses, Ben Griffis' visualizations, and Liam Henshaw's scouting community.
His work demonstrates how technical skills and domain knowledge can transform sports analysis.
