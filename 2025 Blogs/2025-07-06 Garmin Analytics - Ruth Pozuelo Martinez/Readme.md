Ruth has always been interested in data, and starting Curbal allowed her to work with it professionally. She finds Matplotlib exciting because it offers complete control over visualizations. Ruth faces challenges with text curving and packing circles for her project "1 dataset, 100 matplotlib visualizations," which aren't included by default in Matplotlib.

She has created tools for comparing elevation profiles using Garmin data, simplifying tracks to calculate climbs and descents, and visualizing activities on 3D maps. A Python package, garminconnect, helps retrieve data, and she automates the process to create visualizations. Training with Garmin coach has improved her performance significantly, leading her to new projects including better race course profiling and analyzing running technique.
