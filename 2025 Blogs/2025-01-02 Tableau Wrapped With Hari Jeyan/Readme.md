Hari Jeyan, a data professional, created a "Tableau Wrapped" web app inspired by Spotify Wrapped for the Tableau community. He used the Tableau Public API and Streamlit to fetch and display data. Hari faced challenges like not writing code in years and balancing project excitement with fear of not finishing on time. He used Cursor AI for UI design and coding, customized a CV design from Figma, and made the app mobile responsive.
