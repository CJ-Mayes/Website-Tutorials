In his project, Abhinav combined an accordion menu with pagination to improve the structure and interactivity of dashboards. He explains that this method requires thorough data preparation, including identifying necessary fields and removing null values. Various steps include creating parameters for toggle options, calculated fields for different metrics, and designing interactivity for collapsing and expanding menus. 

Additionally, he emphasizes building a dynamic text table that updates based on user selections and suggests pagination to improve user navigation through large datasets. Ultimately, Abhinav aims to provide better UX in Tableau dashboards, making them intuitive for users while maintaining data density.
