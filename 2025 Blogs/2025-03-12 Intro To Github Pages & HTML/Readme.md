Have you ever wanted to share your code and projects in a unique way? Do you want a website without the costs of maintenance and hosting? Today, we will explore how to set up a GitHub HTML template to showcase your work. 
First, log into GitHub and create a public repository. Look for free HTML templates online and include the necessary files: a CSS folder, an images folder, a JS folder, and an index. html file. Drag these files into your repository or clone them using an IDE. 
Then, enable GitHub Pages in settings. Use a YML file to trigger actions for loading your HTML template. You can update content in the template and test locally before publishing. Use commands like git status, git add, git commit, and git push to manage your files and share changes.
