Today, I want to share a unique chart called a radial waterfall chart, which goes beyond the usual bar and line charts. I'm pleased to welcome Kyeongseok MIN (みん) to the blog. Kyeongseok has a background in meteorology and now works as a data scientist focusing on data analysis and visualizations.

This chart visualizes the percentage of Asian restaurants in the U. S. , showing that they make up 12% of all restaurants. I prepared the data from a dataset for the MakeoverMonday 2025 challenge. Using a donut chart, I illustrated the 12% and further broke it down with a radial waterfall chart to explore different categories of Asian restaurants.
