Jordan Pickles, a data analyst, developed an automated ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to create a database of soccer match and shot data from the Understat API. He used Python libraries like Pandas and SQLAlchemy to extract the data, clean and transform it, and load it into a PostgreSQL database. The database consists of two tables - one for match data and one for shot data. This allows for efficient querying and analysis of the data for future projects. The process involved connecting to the database, creating the tables, and efficiently loading the data in batches. The entire code is available in a GitHub repository.
