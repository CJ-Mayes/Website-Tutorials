Main.py will create 2 datasets
The first is the summary stats for the season 2022/23 of the Premier League.

The second is shot data for every player that played in the premier league in 2022/23.
(This shot data if running the code will export every shot for that player regardless of season and league if on understat)
The file i've uploaded with _ EPL is a clean version of that dataset that only looks at Premier League 2022/23
