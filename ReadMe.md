## ⚡ Welcome To What Use To Be CJ-Mayes.com

On 8th October I decided to not renew my site and its content.
</br>The domain will be given up at the end of 2025. 
</br>It has been wonderful creating blog content the last 5 years.
</br>If you'd like to see some of the blogs they can be found by year compressed within the repo.
</br>The folder structure follows the old sites, but most the folders are empty. They will still help you know which file the content you're after is in.

LOGGING OFF, for one final time.
