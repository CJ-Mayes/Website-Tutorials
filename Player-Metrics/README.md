# Player-Metrics
Thanks to Anmol and the mplsoccer website for the example code (Anmol Durgapal). To create your own Tableau pizza plot check out cj-mayes.com. The blog will be called player metrics.
This code will look to re-create the base/background that we use within the Tableau Dashboard when going to map - background map. 

This code does not include any scraping of data from online - and serves solely for the purpose of creating the backdrop for our visualisation.

You can amend the naming conventions as well as the number of parameters. 

Please access cj-mayes.com for the rest of the details on how to create within Tableau.
