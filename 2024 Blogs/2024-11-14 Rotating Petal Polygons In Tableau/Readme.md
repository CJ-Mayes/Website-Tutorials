The website features a tutorial on creating and rotating petal polygons in Tableau. The author, CJ, explains how to transform standard circular shapes into teardrop or petal forms by utilizing specific mathematical calculations.

The tutorial begins by detailing the data setup, including creating four rings and performing a full outer join for data densification. It then introduces the necessary calculations for converting points into a petal shape, including trigonometric functions like cosine and sine to define the x and y coordinates of the shape. The method employs concepts such as ATAN2 for angle conversion and incorporates dimensions to manage different scales of the petals.

CJ also covers how to rotate the petal shapes around a center point. He provides specific formulas to calculate the new x and y coordinates after rotation, allowing for dynamic adjustments through user-defined parameters.

The tutorial emphasizes the math behind the shapes and encourages readers to experiment with different designs, reinforcing the application of mathematical transformations in data visualization. The completed workbook is available for further exploration.
