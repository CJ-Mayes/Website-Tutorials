A tutorial on collecting game day from the play offs, finding a specific games PBP and the associated shot location data using the NBA API

The main script is split into three sections.
The first call gets the details of all the games within the playoff season for last year.
The second part will find all the events for that game.
The third is a call for shot location data for that game.

If you would like to find all the events and all shots for a whole league / season, please take a look at the code stored in the LOOP folder.
